### Image-Based Parking Occupancy Monitoring Innovation

This innovative idea centers on an **automated system for monitoring and calculating parking lot occupancy** within a specific time frame. The goal is to obtain **accurate data on the average number of vehicles occupying parking spaces**, thereby precisely determining the occupancy rate.

**How does it work?**

The system relies on **photos as the primary data source**. These photos can be sent **manually by humans** or **automatically from CCTV cameras**. Once a photo is received, **AI (Artificial Intelligence) with Machine Learning** technology takes over. The AI will **analyze the photo to count the number of detected vehicles** within it. The result of this calculation, namely the vehicle count, will then be **stored in a database** for further analysis.

**Python Script Implementation:**

To realize this idea, a Python script will be the core of the system. Here's a conceptual outline of the steps the script will execute:

1.  **Receiving Photo Input:** The script will be designed to accept image files (traffic or parking area photos) as input. The input sources can vary, from file uploads and local paths to data streams from cameras.
2.  **Processing with AI/Machine Learning:** This is the crucial part of the system. The script will load a **trained Machine Learning model** (for example, a model for vehicle object detection or traffic density classification). This model will then process the images to generate the desired data, such as the number or type of vehicles, or even the level of congestion.
3.  **Result Extraction and Classification:** After processing by the AI, the obtained results (e.g., numbers, labels, or coordinates) will be extracted into a structured format. If necessary, these results can also be further classified.
4.  **Database Storage:** The extracted and classified data will then be automatically stored in a database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, or SQLite) for historical recording and analysis.

**Thus, this innovation enables us to efficiently and automatically monitor parking space utilization, providing valuable information for facility management and urban planning.**
